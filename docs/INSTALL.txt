Installation
------------

To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:

1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``canaimagnulinux.web.locales`` to the list of eggs to
   install::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        canaimagnulinux.web.locales
    zcml =
    	canaimagnulinux.web.locales

After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
take care of updating your system.
